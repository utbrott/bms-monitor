# LoPy Bluetooth service

This part of the project is not finished to working degree.

The service can get a connection between a mobile device and the LoPy4/Pytrack module,
but no data will be sent through the bluetooth.

## Issues with current project

- Not familiar with Bluetooth LE protocol and Python/Micropython to develop a fully working
  project.
